    <h1>         SCHEDULE OF EXQUISITE DINING</h1>
    <h2>              THIS IS PRODUCED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESOLVING DISPUTES WITH THE MENU</h2>
    <p>Our purpose is to ensure that we are consuming all necessary micro and macro nutrients, for all our nutritional requirements
        just as an example we are avoiding potatoes totally but it is rich in vitamin C, which is an antioxidant.
         Another major nutrient in potatoes is potassium, an electrolyte which aids in the workings of our heart, muscles, and nervous system.
         we can line up a lot of things we are missing but actually good for us .
